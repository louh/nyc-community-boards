new york city community boards map
==================================

## work in progress

## Why

This is NYC's official ["Find your community board" page](http://www.nyc.gov/html/cau/html/cb/cb.shtml). To look up your community board you have to figure out how to use their web GIS portal. Why don't we simplify that a little bit? This project is a minimum-viable product inspired by Washington, D.C.'s [ANC Finder](http://ancfinder.org/).

These are some alternatives:

- [Community Districts of New York City - Pediacities](http://nyc.pediacities.com/Community_Districts)
- [Who Represents Me? NYC](http://www.mygovnyc.org/)

## Data sources

- Community district GeoJSON from [data.beta.nyc](http://data.beta.nyc/dataset/nyc-community-districts/resource/d826bbc6-a376-4642-8d8b-3a700d701557). Here is the original data [as GIS shapefile](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Community-Districts/yfnk-k7r4).
- Community board information from [NYC Mayor's Community Affairs Unit - Find Your Community Board](http://www.nyc.gov/html/cau/html/cb/cb.shtml)
